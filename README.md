# try.sh bash script

This script was just provided to get some options with its argument(optional) and execute a bash command. It's really important to enter the options in the right order and their arguments too.

when you go through the script if the command enters in a correct form and execute correctly the result shown you on the screen, but if you enter the command in a wrong way or execute with the false exit code, the script tries to run with a -i (interval per second to wait) and -n (the number of times the command runs).

`try.sh -i [interval-value] -n [number-value] command`
